* This repository contains code done as a part of the Data Structure and Algorithms course done at BITS Pilani.
* It has 2 main branches - master and experiments.  
	* **Master** contains code for the weekly lab assignments along with the lab sheet for the week (PDF).
	* **Experiments** contains code where I explore the different data structures and algorithms that have been taught in the classroom.
