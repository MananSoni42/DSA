# DSA (CS F211)
* This repository contains code done as a part of the Data Structure and Algorithms course done at BITS Pilani.
* It has 2 main branches - master and experiments.  
	* **[master](https://github.com/MananSoni42/DSA/tree/master)**: Contains code where I explore the different data structures and algorithms that have been taught in the classroom.
	* **[lab](https://github.com/MananSoni42/DSA/tree/lab)**: Contains code for the weekly lab assignments along with the lab sheet for the week (PDF).

P.S.
Check out [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/). It is a very effective memory management tool which can automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail.
It has saved hours of my time while debugging (mainly for segfaults).
